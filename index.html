            <h2>Teaching Philosophy</h2>
            <p>
                As an educator, my mission is to inspire and empower the next generation of mathematicians. I believe in fostering a dynamic learning environment where students are encouraged to think critically, problem-solve creatively, and embrace the beauty of mathematical concepts.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Engaging lectures</li>
                <li>Interactive discussions</li>
                <li>Hands-on activities</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Through these methods, I strive to instill in my students a deep appreciation for the elegance and significance of mathematics in our world.
